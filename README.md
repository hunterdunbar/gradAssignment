ASSIGNMENT - "Installing and Using NPM Packages"
NPM is the Package Manager for Node.js. Learning how to leverage the massive library of Node.js packages listed at https://www.npmjs.com/ is critical to developing applications on Node.js. For this assignment, you should clone this repository to your local machine. The problem.js file reads a file with the text of the US Constitution and prints it in the terminal in black and white. We want to highlight specific parts of the Constitution in the log statement.

Your task will be to find an appropriate Node.js package that can change the color of text logged to the CLI.
- Install the Node.js package into your project
- Change the color of any logged paragraph that contains the word "People" (case sensitive) to green
- Change the color of any logged paragraph that contains the word "Congress" (case sensitive) to blue
- Change the color of any logged paragraph that contains the word "President" (case sensitive) to yellow
- If a paragraph contains multiple instances of these criteria, the priority should be People, Congress, President. (i.e. If a paragraph contains both "People" and "President" it would be colored green.)
- Upload your code to github with instructions for running your code.
